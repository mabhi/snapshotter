create a cr to take user input, when this cr is created the controller will detect it and depending on it, it will spin up a cr for snapshot

to restore, we need create a pv where source has to be kept as snapshot, and then deployment has to modified and run again
for restore we can do it in the same crd, one field can be kept as boolean?
